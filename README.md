# EZlang
***EZlang*** is a open source programming language made in python, and this contains the beta verison of the language!
# ***How to install***:
Open the ezcode.py file in your IDE, and copy the ezcode.py from this branch into that, replacing the file. Do not use the "Update" button, as that will get the latest release, not the beta.
The verison is also currently not working, will fix that very soon.
